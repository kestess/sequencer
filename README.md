=========

Written for a Code Eval challenge and passes all desk checks and testing including the two examples provided. 

For some reason, goes over the 10 seconds allowed on Code Eval and I'm not sure why. I might have to use an iterative solution and/or not use all allowed combinations.

A test with nearly 400 items against 3 items takes ~90 seconds on my Mac Mini. This is roughly worst case. Perhaps it is assumed the first chars are the same, but if I assume that, shouldn't I assume the last ones match too? This is a solution with no assumptions, but it appears I'll have to guess the requirements and fix it later.
